# Starship Traveler Blazor Demo

![Screenshot](starship-travel.gif)

I created this demo app for the [DevOne 2019 conference](https://devone.at). I showcases the capabilities of the ASP.NET Core Blazor framework.

**Note** that this sample will not be continuously maintained. I will update it every now and then whenever I use it in workshops and/or conference talks. If you update and/or extend it, feel free to send me a pull request.
