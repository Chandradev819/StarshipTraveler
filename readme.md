# Starship Traveler Blazor Demo

![Screenshot](starship-travel.gif)

I created this demo app for the [DevOne 2019 conference](https://devone.at). It has been updated for my Blazor sessions at [Techorama Belgium 2019](https://techorama.be/) and [.NET Day Switzerland](https://dotnetday.ch/). It showcases the capabilities of the ASP.NET Core Blazor framework.

**Note** that this sample will not be continuously maintained. I will update it every now and then whenever I use it in workshops and/or conference talks. If you update and/or extend it, feel free to send me a pull request.
