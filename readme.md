# Starship Traveler Blazor Demo

![Screenshot](starship-travel.gif)

I created this demo app for the [DevOne 2019 conference](https://devone.at). I showcases the capabilities of the ASP.NET Core Blazor framework.

## Replay Demo?

Do you want to try the demo yourself? Here is what you do:

* [Install *Blazor*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/spa/blazor/get-started) and its requirements.

* Clone the repository.

* Open the solution in the [*Start*](Start) folder.

* Follow the steps mentioned in [*storyboard.md*](storyboard.md). You will find the files referenced there in the [*Assets*](Assets) folder.

## Recording
